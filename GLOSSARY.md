# Glossary

- container: a running (or stopped) instance of an image with its own writable layer and runtime config
- image: an OCI artifact composed of layers + config; used as a template for containers
- registry: a service that stores and distributes images
- tag: a movable name that points to an image (example: `:latest`)
- digest: a content-addressed identifier for an image (example: `@sha256:...`)
- rootless: running Podman as a normal user using user namespaces
- Quadlet: systemd integration that generates service units from `.container`/`.pod`/`.volume`/`.network` files
- SELinux: a Linux MAC system; on Fedora/RHEL it can affect mounts and container permissions
- namespace: a Linux kernel isolation feature; containers commonly use PID, mount, and network namespaces
- cgroups v2: the kernel resource-control mechanism used for CPU/memory limits and systemd integration
- user namespace: a namespace that remaps UIDs/GIDs; enables rootless containers to have "root" inside without host root
- subuid/subgid: per-user UID/GID ranges used for user namespace mappings (rootless)
- writable layer: the per-container filesystem layer on top of the image; it is not durable persistence
- volume: Podman-managed persistent storage intended for stateful data
- bind mount: a host path mounted into a container; often used for config and source code
- network (user-defined): a named bridge network with DNS enabled for container name resolution
- aardvark-dns: Podman’s embedded DNS service for user-defined networks
- netavark: Podman’s networking stack used to configure networks and DNS (modern Podman)
- slirp4netns: a user-mode networking helper commonly used for rootless containers
- pasta: a newer user-mode networking helper often used for rootless containers
- healthcheck: an image or runtime-defined command that reports container health (used by tooling/systemd policies)
- linger: systemd feature that allows user services to run at boot without an interactive login
